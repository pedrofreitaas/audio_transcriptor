# Audio transcriptor.

```bash
Simple script in python to transcript the content of a video/audio.
Step-by-step guide:

1Âº -> Run the program "./main.py".
2Âº -> Put the .mp4 videos or .mp3/.wav audios in the "source/" generated folder.
3Âº -> Run the program again, and all the audio content will be transcripted.

OBS: 
* "This program uses the SpeechRecognition python's module, it means that the
transcription is the result of the interpretation of Google's API voice recognition."
* "All the individual modules work by themselves. So, if there is the need to convert
.mp4's to .mp3's, transcript .wav directly, unite .txt's, convert .mp3's to .wav's, 
choose a folder from path or divide .wav's, it's possible without calling './main.py'."
```
