# Audio transcriptor.

```bash
Simple script in python to transcript the content of a video/audio.
Step-by-step guide:

1Âº -> Run the program.
2Âº -> Put the .mp4 videos or .mp3/.wav audios in the "source/" generated folder.
3Âº -> Run the program again, and all the audio content will be transcripted.

OBS: "This program uses the SpeechRecognition python's module, it means that the
transcription is the result of the interpretation of Google's API voice recognition."
